# Introduction
A Ring Oscillator is device which uses a odd number of inverters to make oscillations. This circuit has a positive feedback loop which helps to attain sustained oscillations. Here in this design we are going design a five stage ring oscillator. These ring oscillator circuits are used in Integrated Circuits which has low power applications.
